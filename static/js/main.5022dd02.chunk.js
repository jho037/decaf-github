Even under heavy taint analysis workloads, DECAF++ has a much better performance, around 25% faster on nbench, because of its elasticity. DECAF++ elasticity makes it a very suitable case for security analysis tasks that would selectively analyze the input e.g. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that can filter out benign traffic.
